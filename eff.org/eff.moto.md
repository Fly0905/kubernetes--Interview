>   世界各地的EFF成员都在推动互联网自由运动，并确保各地的技术用户都有经验丰富的倡导者准备采取行动。我们在一起将为在线隐私，思想的自由交流以及在公众利益排在公司和政界人士面前的世界而奋斗。在您的帮助下，美好的数字未来是可能的。



>   Over 30,000 EFF donors around the world power the movement for Internet freedom. Our activism, technology development, policy analysis, and impact litigation is only possible with broad support from the public. We are proud that the majority of EFF’s funding comes from ordinary individuals, and over 80% of that funding consists of donations under $10,000. Direct contributions from businesses of any size comprised just 6% of our total public support.

>   EFF received a four-star rating (the highest possible) and a perfect score of 100 in accountability and transparency from watchdog Charity Navigator, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing an unbiased, objective, and numbers-based assessment of over 9,000 charities. EFF is also careful to keep administration and fundraising expenses low, with 74% of funds supporting programs.

>   全球有30,000多名EFF捐助者为互联网自由运动提供动力。只有在公众的广泛支持下，我们的行动主义，技术发展，政策分析和影响诉讼才有可能。我们为EFF的大部分资金来自普通人而感到自豪，其中超过80％的资金来自10,000美元以下的捐款。任何规模的企业直接贡献的资金仅占我们公共支持总额的6％。EFF获得了看门狗Charity Navigator（一家非营利组织，致力于为9,000多家慈善机构提供公正，客观和基于数字的评估）的四星级（最高评分）以及在问责制和透明度方面的满分100。EFF还谨慎地保持较低的管理和筹款费用，其中74％的资金支持计划。我邀请您查看以下EFF 2017年7月至2018年6月财政年度的财务报告。感谢您支持数字公民自由，并确保EFF的工作始终保持强烈独立。
